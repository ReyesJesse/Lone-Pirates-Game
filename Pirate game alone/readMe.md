First step to making JS game is to set up the project with canvas 
give it a width and height,
<!-- const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); 
ALWAYS
ctx.fillStyle = "white";
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

 -->
 Next step is to create a player block thats going to represent our player model
 give it a fill rect and style to display it.

 Animate it using an animation function thats requests animation frame
